# Altera MAX II Fuse Map (by experiment)

This is a puzzle.
Can I work out the fuse map of MAX II devices by
feeding the Quartus tools
and observing the outputs?

My experiments are being run in the following
[environment](doc/environment.md).

## Assumptions

 * [Fuse ordering](doc/fuse-ordering.md)
 * [Fuse vs bit](doc/fuse-vs-bit.md)
 * [Default user code](doc/default-user-code.md)

## Experiments

 * [How to indicate a global clock](experiments/src/global_clock_experiment.erl)
 * [User code](experiments/src/user_code_experiment.erl)
 * [Fuse count](experiments/src/fuse_count_experiment.erl)
 * [Generate pins](experiments/src/generate_pins.erl)
 * [Bus-hold](experiments/src/bus_hold_experiment.erl)
 * [Weak pull-up](experiments/src/weak_pull_up_experiment.erl)
 * [LUT](experiments/src/lut_experiment.erl)

## Fuses

### `{user_code, bit()}`

There are 32 bits of user oode numbered LSB (0) to MSB (31).

The user code bits are stored in the POF file inverted,
so a user code bit of `1` is stored as a `0`.

### `{ioc(), bus_hold}` and `{ioc(), weak_pull_up}`

Each IOC can have bus-hold or weak pull-up enabled.

The feature is enabled when the POF bit is `0`.

Warning: only enable *one* at a time.

### `{lc(), lut, {a0 | a1, b0 | b1, c0 | c1, d0 | d1}}`

Each LC as a 16-entry LUT with a fuse per entry.

The fuse for LUT term `a AND (NOT b) AND c AND d`
is named `{lc(), lut, {a1, b0, c1, d1}}`.

The stored bit is the result of the lookup.
